# Surgical Equipment System

This is the README file for the Surgical Equipment System project developed in C++ using a 32-bit compiler and the `cgraphics` header file.

## Project Description

The Surgical Equipment System is a C++ program that utilizes the `cgraphics` library for graphical user interface (GUI) development. It provides a platform for managing surgical equipment in a hospital or healthcare facility. The system allows users to perform various operations such as adding new equipment, updating equipment details, and generating reports.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Surgical Equipment System program, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- 32-bit C++ Compiler: Install a 32-bit C++ compiler to compile and run the program successfully.
- `cgraphics` Header File: Download and include the `cgraphics` header file in the project to enable GUI functionality.
- WinBGIm Window: Install the WinBGIm library to support graphical operations in the program.

## Setting up the Project

To set up the Surgical Equipment System project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files as a ZIP archive.
2. Install the 32-bit C++ compiler on your system.
3. Download the `cgraphics` header file and place it in a suitable location on your system.
4. Open the `main.cpp` file in a text editor.
5. Locate the line that includes the `cgraphics` header file.
6. Modify the include path in the `#include` directive to reflect the path where you placed the header file(util.h,login.h,orders.h give full path of the header file present in your system).
7. Save the `main.cpp` file.

## Running the Program

To run the Surgical Equipment System program, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved the project files.
3. Compile the `main.cpp` file using the installed 32-bit C++ compiler.
4. Once compiled successfully, run the generated executable.
5. The program will prompt you to log in with a username and password.
6. Enter "admin" as the username and "Admin@01" as the password.
7. If the login credentials are correct, the program will display the main menu and allow you to perform various operations.
